# nft-project
Developed a Solidity smart contract for hosting a non-fungible token (NFT) auction
on the Ethereum blockchain.
Implemented functions for starting, bidding, and ending the auction, with validation
checks for each stage.
Used events to track auction progress and notify participants of key events such as bids
and the end of the auction.
Ensured secure and reliable handling of bids and payments using payable functions
and proper validation of transactions.
